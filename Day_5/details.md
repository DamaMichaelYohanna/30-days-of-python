__Searching__ can be seen as a way of looking for the existence of a value in a linear or non-linear Data Structure.
is a linear data structure. This operation can be broadly divided into two: for linear and non-linear DS.

is still in use for searching. 

The contained python files has a simple implementation of a __Linear Search__ for sorted and unsorted data.
