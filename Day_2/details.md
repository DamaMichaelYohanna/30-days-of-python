# Double linked List
A double linked list is a type of linear data structure (list) with two pointers between two successive node. 
It's a bidirectional list such
that you move from left to right and also from right to left. 
 
Just like the python the singlylinklist, the double linked list allow operations like:
- appending(insert)
- remove
- search
- size(length)

Just like the __singlylinkedlist__ To successfully build a __doublelinkedlist__, you most first of all have nodes which
will hold the data and the reference
to the next and previous data in the sequence. 

The contained python files are a simple implementation of a singlylinkedlist and a simple test to check the few 
functionality added.
