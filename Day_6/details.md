# Binary Search algorithm.
__Binary Searching__ is a searching algorithm much more efficient than the linear search. It allows us search faster by 
reducing the number of possible search terms after every iteration. As the name binary applies, we find a way of assuming
whether the search item is within the first half or second half. This will give us a clue as to where we can easily 
find the item. For us to build a binary search, the list has to be sorted.

The contained python files has a simple implementation of a __Binary Search__ for sorted data.
