# Singly linked List
A singly linked list is a type of list with one pointer between two successive node. It's a single direction list such
that you move from left to right but not from right to left. 
 
Just like the python list, the singly linked list allow operations like:
- appending(insert)
- remove
- search
- size(length)

To successfully build a singly linked list, you most first of all have nodes which will hold the data and the reference
to the next data in the sequence. 

The contained python files are a simple implementation of a singlylinkedlist and a simple test to check the few 
functionality added.
