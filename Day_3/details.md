# Stack Data structure
A __Stack__ is a linear data structure which allow pilling up or adding node one on top the other. It's follows the 
**Last-In-First-Out(LIFO)** principles. Each node has a pointing to the next node above it.

Stack has majorly two operation: 
- push(insert a new node on top of the stack)
- pop(remove and return the topmost node)
- peck(view a particular node without deleting it)
- size(length of the stack)

To implement stack successfully, we need to first of all have nodes which
will hold the data and the reference
to the next node in the sequence. 

The contained python files are a simple implementation of a __stack__ data structure and a simple test to check the 
few functionality added.
